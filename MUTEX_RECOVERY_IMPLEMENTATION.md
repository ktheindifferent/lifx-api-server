# Mutex Poisoning Recovery Implementation

## Summary
Implemented robust mutex poisoning recovery mechanisms throughout the codebase to handle panic scenarios gracefully.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Mutex Utilities Module (`src/mutex_utils.rs`)
- **`safe_lock<T>`**: Basic safe lock with automatic recovery from poisoning
- **`safe_lock_with_recovery<T, F>`**: Custom recovery logic for poisoned mutexes
- **`safe_lock_monitored<T>`**: Enhanced lock with monitoring and metrics
- **`safe_try_lock<T>`**: Non-blocking lock with poisoning recovery
- **`MutexMonitor`**: Global monitoring structure for tracking poisoning events

### 2. Updated Dependencies
- Added `lazy_static = "1.4"` for global mutex monitoring

### 3. Replaced Unsafe Mutex Operations
- **`src/scenes.rs`**: Replaced all `.lock().unwrap()` calls with `safe_lock_monitored`
- **`tests/concurrent_stress_test.rs`**: Updated test code to use safe mutex utilities

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/mutex_poisoning_test.rs`)
- Test basic recovery from poisoning
- Test custom recovery logic
- Test try_lock with poisoning
- Test monitoring and metrics
- Test concurrent recovery under stress
- Test nested mutex recovery
- Test data integrity preservation
- Performance overhead testing

## Key Features

### Recovery Strategies
1. **Automatic Recovery**: Continues operation with potentially inconsistent data while logging the event
2. **Custom Recovery**: Allows providing a recovery function to fix inconsistent state
3. **Monitoring**: Tracks poisoning events for operational visibility

### Error Handling
- All mutex operations return `Result<T, String>` for proper error propagation
- Graceful degradation when mutex operations fail
- Comprehensive logging of all poisoning events

## Test Results
✅ All 8 mutex poisoning tests passing
✅ All 5 concurrent stress tests passing
✅ No performance regression (overhead < 2x for safe operations)

## Production Considerations
1. **Monitoring**: The `MUTEX_MONITOR` global tracks poisoning events
2. **Logging**: All poisoning events are logged with `error!` level
3. **Recovery**: Automatic recovery allows continued operation but may have inconsistent state
4. **Performance**: Minimal overhead for safe operations in non-poisoned cases

## Usage Example
```rust
use crate::mutex_utils::{safe_lock, safe_lock_with_recovery};

// Basic usage
let guard = safe_lock(&mutex)?;

// With custom recovery
let guard = safe_lock_with_recovery(&mutex, |data| {
    // Reset to safe state
    data.reset();
})?;

// With monitoring
let guard = safe_lock_monitored(&mutex, "critical_section")?;
```
